# altium-libraries

## Collision Avoidance!
Unfortunately git does not recognise the formats Altium uses to store the libraries. So we need to be careful as there now is the possibility to overwrite someone else's library. As a result we need to have a register to allocate who can push to that library. If you need to make a change to the library either get the person who 'owns' it to do it or get them to 'un-own' it!

__Do not push to the library unless you have immediately checked you have ownership__

# Ownerships

# Naming Convention
It would be nice to have everything sorted by function then manufacturer, then component. As such the STM32F072xB would come under: Microcontrollers -> STM -> STM32F072xB. Some things wont conform to that, but it would be nice to keep it as neet as possible.
